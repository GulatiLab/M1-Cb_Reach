If possible, please reference this page in your publication.

Contents:
circ_r 					resultant vector length
circ_mean 			mean direction of a sample of circular data
circ_std 				dispersion around the mean direction
circ_var 				circular variance
circ_dist				pairwise distances around a circle
circ_confmean 	confidence intervals for mean direction

circ_rtest			Rayleigh's test for nonuniformity
circ_vtest			V-Test for nonuniformity with known mean direction
circ_mtest			One-sample test for specified mean direction
circ_wwtest			Two-sample test for equal means

circ_corrcc			Circular-circular correlation coefficient
circ_corrcl			Circular-linear correlation coefficient

rad2ang					Convert radian to angular values
ang2rad					Convert angular to radian values

All functions take arguments in radians (expect for ang2rad). For a detailed description of arguments and outputs consult the help text in the files.

The implementation follows in most cases 'Biostatistical Analysis' and all referenced equations and tables are taken from this book, if not otherwise noted. In some cases, the other two books were preferred for implementation was more straightforward for solutions presented there.

Versions:
Compared with an earlier version from 2006, the code has been cleaned up, some extra functionality and new tests have been added and some bugs removed. New features include confidence limits on the mean, the vtest, mtest, wwtest and corrcl commands for additional hypothesis testing and correlation analysis. If you have suggestions, feature requests or want to contribute code, please email me.

Disclaimer:
All functions in this toolbox were implemented with care and thoroughly tested on the examples presented in 'Biostatistical Analysis' were possible. Nevertheless, they may contain errors or bugs, which may affect the outcome of your analysis. I do not take responsibility for any harm coming from using this toolbox, neither if it is caused by errors in the software nor if it is caused by its improper application.
